# Decode Morse Messages

## About 

> In this project my partner and I created a couple functions in Ruby to decode Morse messages.
The code is written in [main.rb](/main.rb) and consists in three functions:

- `decode_morse_char`: takes a character encoded in Morse, and returns the corresponding character in uppercase.
- `decode_morse_word`: takes a word encoded in Morse, and returns the corresponding word in uppercase.
- `decode_morse_message`: takes a string encoded in Morse, and returns the corresponding string representation.
